This is the official source repository for the AES Crypt software
available from www.aescrypt.com.

AES Crypt was initially developed for Windows and then later ported to Linux.
Other versions of the software, including Mac, Java, Android, and iOS, were
created, most of which were derived from the Linux code.

The code for each platform is stored in a directory for that platform
(e.g., Windows and Linux).  A "Readme.txt" file exists in each that provides
any additional information that might be useful for that platform.

Some of the source code is not yet published here, though all source code
is still available from https://www.aescrypt.com/download/.  I will
continue to work with maintainers to bring all of the source code to
this repository and update it periodically.

Cheers!
